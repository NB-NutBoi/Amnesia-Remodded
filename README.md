# Amnesia : Remodded
A modified game executable using BUzzer's x64 fork that adds a bunch of new functions and options for modders to play around with.

Made by NutBoi & Nate with the help of the Frictional games discord community.

Current version: 1.1 PREVIEW

SOME THINGS WONT WORK OR AREN'T FULLY IMPLEMENTED, ALSO YOU CANT COMPILE DUE TO ERRORS

## Key changes:
- Infinite lanterns.
- Multiple arms (not fully working as expected yet).
- A way to remove notes from the journal.
- AngelScript Update().
- Some other miscellaneous functions:
	- Getting rotation of player camera/entities

## Compiling:
Should be as simple as BUzzer's x64 fork.
